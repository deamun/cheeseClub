## General Info

This project was created as part of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering path. The goal was to create a responsive wesbite for a fictional club.

The site is hosted using GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://deamun.github.io/cheeseClub/).

The majority of the responsiveness is created using flexbox and media queries, with responsive units like `em` and percentages.

I used to work as a cheesemaker in a Melbourne delicatessen, and wanted to create something similar to this site when I was there.
