                    <img src="resources/images/burrata.jpg" alt="Burrata with figs">
                    
                    <p class="description">Burrata is an incredibly soft stretched curd cheese, originating from the Puglia region of South East Italy, first created in approximately 1920. Handmade daily in Carlton, Melbourne using only fresh Australian cows milk, the supple outer mozzarella shell contains a luxuriously soft and delicate interior made of shredded mozzarella and cream.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you can resist devouring it as it is, try spreading on warm crusty sourdough, with fresh cracked pepper!</p>
                </div>

                    <img src="resources/images/laPrimavera.jpg" alt="Wheel of La Primavera Cheese, coated in dried flowers">
                    
                    <p class="description">La Primavera pays homage to the moment spring emerges in Adelaide Hills. Made from the first raw milk of the spring season, using classic alpine techniques to create a truly unique cheese. The aroma of dried spring flowers contrast the slightly pungent rind, and the paste has a rich buttery flavour balanced by a delicate nutiness - think butterscotch flavours!</p>
                    <p>Section28 only makes La Primavera with spring milk and is available from February to April each year.</p>

                    <p class="description">A true Fermier Cheese, made by hand from milk produced by animals raised on the cheesemaker's property, right here in Victoria! Dreaming Goat Dairy's Chevre is a reflection of exceptional farming practices and cheesemaking. It is fresh, with hints of lemon curd, extremely clean flavour, with a rich tongue coating mouthfeel. Tastes of fresh clean goats milk with a hint of lactic fermentation.</p>
                    <p>A stunning example of quality through simple perfection.</p>

                    <p class="about">When Sarah Ajzner started Dreaming Goat Dairy, they had a herd of 24 milking goats and a vision. Since then, their herd has continued to grow, and the quality of their cheese has improved continuously. They believe that it is an incredible privelege to be entrusted with, and trusted by their herd - and it shows in the quality of their products, with their chevre winning the Gold Medal at the Victorian Produce awards.</p>
